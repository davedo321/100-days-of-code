# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 30 2016


**Today's Progress**: Continued Learning CSS. FreeCodeCamp Level 57 - Level 91
**Thoughts:** I've been working on getting into a deeper depth of Ruby as well as CSS and thought that http://www.freecodecamp.com was a good way to start for more front end and https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/ for the Ruby. 

**Link to work:** http://allegrosgroup.com/davedo321/ is a simple start to a blog that will have more indepth posts.

### Day 1: Dec 31 2016


**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS as well as initial JQuery Basic Tutorial
**Thoughts:** Writing it out vs. reading about what the code does, is an enormous difference in retention. Even if some of it is forgotton, once referenced back to the work that is completed - it is instantaniously grasped. 
**Link to work:** Signed up to Code Pen http://codepen.io/davedo321/

### Day 2: Jan 1 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting on a Tribute Page
**Thoughts:** As per https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page I'm attempting to build a tribute page. It was going to be on Code Pen - but I realized that if I'm going to do this, I am going to do it right. I then added Bootstrap to the Blog Ghost platform for the davedo321 blog. Note: A guided tutorial is MUCH faster then a self run project.  
**Link to work:** TBD

### Day 3: Jan 2 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Tribute Page and Working on Basic JavaScript 
**Thoughts:** I'm an content with the Tribute page, but would like to add more content in the future. Also, worked on the JavaScript of FreeCodeCamp. (Level 160)

### Day 4: Jan 3 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through JavaScript and some Ruby
**Thoughts:** I have ceom to the realization that all the basic logic is the same, it's just different languages. Similar to a sentance structure. (Javascript: Level 172, Ruby: 3/8 done week 2)

### Day 5: Jan 4 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost done Ruby Week 2 on Coursera and completed if Statements for Javascript
**Thoughts:**
