# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 30 2016


**Today's Progress**: Continued Learning CSS. Current Level 57
**Thoughts:** I've been working on getting into a deeper depth of Ruby as well as CSS and thought that http://www.freecodecamp.com was a good way to start for more front end and https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/ for the Ruby. 

**Link to work:** http://allegrosgroup.com/davedo321/ is a simple start to a blog that will have more indepth posts.
