# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 30 2016


**Today's Progress**: Continued Learning CSS. FreeCodeCamp Level 57 - Level 91
**Thoughts:** I've been working on getting into a deeper depth of Ruby as well as CSS and thought that http://www.freecodecamp.com was a good way to start for more front end and https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/ for the Ruby. 

**Link to work:** http://allegrosgroup.com/davedo321/ is a simple start to a blog that will have more indepth posts.

### Day 1: Dec 31 2016


**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS as well as initial JQuery Basic Tutorial
**Thoughts:** Writing it out vs. reading about what the code does, is an enormous difference in retention. Even if some of it is forgotton, once referenced back to the work that is completed - it is instantaniously grasped. 
**Link to work:** Signed up to Code Pen http://codepen.io/davedo321/

### Day 2: Jan 1 2017


**Today's Progress**: Starting on a Tribute Page
**Thoughts:** As per https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page I'm attempting to build a tribute page. It was going to be on Code Pen - but I realized that if I'm going to do this, I am going to do it right. I then added Bootstrap to the Blog Ghost platform for the davedo321 blog. Note: A guided tutorial is MUCH faster then a self run project.  
**Link to work:** TBD
